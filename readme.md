This project contains algorithms I studied during Stanford's Algorithms Specialization on Coursera. Throughout the course, I will try to implement each algorithm and optional content as frequently as possible. Everything will be in C++. Premake5 is used to generate the project and chrono is used to output the processing time.

Day 1: Implemented Karatsuba multiplication which runs in O(n^1.6) time compared to traditional multiplication's O(n^2) time. I used strings to store the large numbers.
