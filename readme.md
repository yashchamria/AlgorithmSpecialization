This project contains algorithms I studied during Stanford's Algorithms Specialization on Coursera. Throughout the course, I will try to implement each algorithm and optional content as frequently as possible. Everything will be in C++. Premake5 is used to generate the project and Chrono is used to output the processing time.

Divide and Conquer algorithms:

Day 1: Implemented Karatsuba multiplication which runs in O(n^1.6) time compared to traditional multiplication's O(n^2) time. I used strings to store the large numbers.

Day 2: Implemented Merge sort and Inversion counting(number of pairs required to switch places to create a sorted array). These simple algorithms demonstrate the power of divide and conquer quite well. Both runs in O(nlogn) time compare to O(n^2) of brute force approach.
